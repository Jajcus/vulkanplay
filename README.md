I have written this code trying to learn the Vulkan API, just out of curiosity.

I had little prior knowledge of 3D graphics programming and I have never coded
with OpenGL. It took nearly two weeks to get the simple tetrahedron displayed, but
Vulkan was never supposed to be easy and no one is supposed to learn 3D graphics
with Vulkan.

Be warned: better don't use this code for reference.
